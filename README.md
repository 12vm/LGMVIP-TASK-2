# LGMVIP-TASK-2
STOCK MARKET PREDICTION AND FORECASTING USING STACKED LSTM ON GOOGLE COLABS .
IT PREDICTS THE OPENING AND CLOSING STOCK PRICE FOR THE SECIFIED TIMESTEP(ARGUMENT PROVIDED IN THE CODE).
-> DATASET NSETATAGLOBAL CONTAINS 9 COLUMNS WHICH DEFINES THE OPENING , CLOSING , PEAK , LOWEST, LAST (PRICE OF STOCK WHEN PURCHASED) OF STOCK PRICE ON THAT GIVEN DATE(DATE COLUMN).
   THERE ARE ALSO TOTAL TRADE QUANTITY AND TURNOVER COLUMNS FOR FURTHER HIGH LEVEL INFO FOR THAT GIVEN DAY.
-> FIRST THE DATASET IS LOADED INTO THE COLABS NOTEBOOK .
-> DATASET IS PREVIEWED USING HEAD, DESCRIBE AD BOTTOM FUNCTION.
-> DATASET DATE IS CONVERTED FROM STRING TO DATETIME FORMAT AND SORTED THE WHOLE DATASET BY DATE.
->LINE CHART IS PLOTTED FOR OPENNING AND CLOSING PRICE FOR THAT DAY USING MATPLOT LIBRARY.
->NOW PREPATION FOR ANALYSIS BEGINS:
  ->NORMALIZED THE DATASET VALUES TO [0,1] USING MINMAXSCALER FUNCTION.
    THIS ENSURED EVERY DATA VALUE IS WITHIN A SPECIFIED RANGE.
  ->NOW SPLITTING THE DATASET INTO TEST AND TRAIN FOR TESTING AND TRAINING PURPOSE SO THAT MODEL PREDICTION CAN BE EVALUATED.
  ->THEN THE TRAIN DATA IS DIVIDED INTO INPUT AND OUTPUT DATA AS X_train and Y_train.SAME IS DONE FOR TEST DATA.
  ->THEN it is passed to the LSTM FUNCTION TO APPLY IT TO THE DATASET FOR TRAINING PURPOSE.ONCE TRAINING IS DOEN THROUGH LSTM , THE PREDICTIONS ARE MADE ON TEST DATA .
  ->ERROR PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED .
